# CommerceCase
A Short timed case for KonusarakOgren Company. Simple E-Commerce Backend Example with Identity and Generic Repository Pattern

This was the first time i've used the Identity Framework, i had some issues integrating Identity with my generic repo pattern.
as i had little time i couldn't make it all and it lacks features connected to role system, commenting and buying and also frontend.
